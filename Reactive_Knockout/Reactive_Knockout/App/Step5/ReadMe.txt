Step 5
Add the ability to LOCK a record from one client and 
have all other clients automatically receive that message
and show that particular row as locked and uneditable
(Only one can edit a record at a time)

Has a bug.  IF a user kills their exporer session while
they have an item locked - it is locked forever.  This is 
fixed in step 6
